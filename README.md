## API
**BiomeBrushes** are shown when "Biome" is enabled
**ColorBrushes** are shown when "Biome" is disabled

If you want to create a own brush just extend from **"BiomeBrush"** or **"ColorBrush"**\
[in net.arcaniax.gopaint.paint.brush]

You can add only up to **9** settings for a brush.
If you try to add more than 9, the constructor throws an error. **(IllegalArgumentException)**

When you initialize your plugin add the brush to the PlayerBrushManager.\
[GoPaint.getBrushManager()]


**ColorBrush:** **GoPaint.getBrushManager().getColorBrushes().add(new ExampleBrush());
<br><br>
**BiomeBrush:** GoPaint.getBrushManager().getBiomesBrushes().add(new ExampleBrush());

## Example Class:

    public class ExampleBrush extends ColorBrush {
        public ExampleBrush() {
            super(new BrushSettings[] {
                    BrushSettings.SIZE,
            });
        }

        @Override
        public String getName() {
            return "Example Brush";
        }

        @Override
        public String[] getDescription() {
            return new String[] {"ยง7Only works as example"};
        }
        /**
        * https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/
        * Click on a head you want to use
        * Scroll below to "OTHER"
        * Copy "Value"
        @Override
        public String getSkin() {
            return "HEAD SKIN";
        }

        @Override
        public void paintRight(AbstractPlayerBrush playerBrush, MutableVector3 clickedVector, Player player,
        EditSession editSession) {
            ...
        }
    }
