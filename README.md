## API

If you want to create a own brush just extend from **"BiomeBrush"** or **"ColorBrush"** [in net.arcaniax.gopaint.objects.brush]

BiomeBrushes are shown when "Biome" is enabled
ColorBrushes are shown when "Biome" is disabled

You can add only upto **9** settings for a brush.

When you initialize your plugin add the brush to the PlayerBrushManager

**ColorBrush:** GoPaintPlugin.getBrushManager().getColorBrushes().add(new ExampleBrush());
<br><br>
**BiomeBrush:** GoPaintPlugin.getBrushManager().getBiomeBrushes().add(new ExampleBrush());

    public class ExampleBrush extends ColorBrush {
        public ExampleBrush() {
            super(new BrushSettings[] {
                    BrushSettings.SIZE,
            });
        }

        @Override
        public String getName() {
            return "Example Brush";
        }

        @Override
        public String[] getDescription() {
            return new String[] {"ยง7Only works as example"};
        }
        /**
        * https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/
        * Click on a head you want to use
        * Scroll below to "OTHER"
        * Copy "Value"
        @Override
        public String getSkin() {
            return "HEAD SKIN";
        }

        @Override
        public void paintRight(AbstractPlayerBrush playerBrush, Location loc, Player p, EditSession session) {
        }
    }
